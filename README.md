# Raspberry Pi Spotify Display

This is a little program that displays whatever song you are currently listening to on Spotify.

## Required Hardware

- Raspberry Pi (any model but I recommend using a Raspi Zero 2 W).
- Waveshare 2.13" e-Paper Display (HAT mode recommended).
- 5V 3A Power Supply (or a PiSugar battery pack).

## Required Software

- Any OS will work, I have only tested on Raspberry Pi OS Lite 32-bit though.
- Python 3.10+
- Last.fm Account (and API key)
